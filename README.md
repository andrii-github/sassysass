# SassySass
[![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/sassysass.svg)](http://badge.fury.io/js/sassysass)

With a simple command, add a well-structured architecture for your project's CSS. Based off the [SMACSS](https://smacss.com/) methodology, SassySass creates a simple, maintainable structure for your Sass files.

## Install

```js
npm install sassysass -g
```
## Use
Run ```sassysass``` in your project directory.

To create new individual Sass files run ```sassysass-page```. If the name isn't set the file will be named 'page' and if the path isn't set it assumes the directory is 'sass'.

To create new Sass module run ```sassysass-module```. If the name isn't set the file will be named 'module' and if the path isn't set it assumes the directory is 'sass/modules'.
